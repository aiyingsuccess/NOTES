torch.nn only supports mini-batches. The entire torch.nn package only supports inputs that are a mini-batch of samples, and not a single sample.

For example, nn.Conv2d will take in a 4D Tensor of nSamples x nChannels x Height x Width.

If you have a single sample, just use input.unsqueeze(0) to add a fake batch dimension.
