1. redefined error happens when some variables are defined in std library 
even if you did not include the libraries or headers in your source file. eg:change 
vaiabe time to timee because time is defined in the <time.h> actually I didn't include <time.h>!

2.A template-parameter shall not be redeclared within its scope (including nested scopes). A template- parameter shall not have the same name as the template name.
